            <h3>My Journey Towards Web Development</h3>
            <p>Our journey is our own, and it is filled with lots of challenges as well as opportunities. Starting my coding journey through Python has been a great experience so far.  <br>
            While diving into the world of Web Development, everything seemed so intimidating. However, as I progressed, the art of web design was what I truly desired. </p>

            <img src="img_learning.jpeg" alt="" >
            <h3>Basic Learnings</h3>
            <p class="p1">Starting with the fundamentals, I learned to structure the webpage through HTML. The use of correct tags and elements is really important for the proper functioning of the website. <br> 
            When I moved to CSS, it was even more exicting experience because the power CSS holds is just wonderful. Stylying and transforming a basic HTML into an art is what i loved more. Although it is very hard to manage everything. <br>
            Still it is worth all the hassle.</p>

            <h3>Design and Debugging</h3>
            <p>Designing the website's interface was very challenging as well as satisfying. I experimented with various colors and finally chose my theme colors. I went to all black with a dash of yellow. Black because everyones loves darkmode and to add a pop of soothing color I used yellow. <br>
            I just took some concepts on how should I do this from diffent youtube channels and finally created my whole new different project. <br>
            Among all this debugging was not that difficult then I was expecting. Everything went smoothly just faced a few problems with my layout inconsistency and fewer tags problems.  </p>

            <h3>Design Decision</h3>
            <p>For the font, I chose (arial, sans-serif), because I found this very simple and clean looking which increases its readability.
                I chose my images to be in circle shape. For the projects, I placed an empty placeholder which I can modify in accordance with future
                projects. I attached my photo with the background image because of which it sticks around with the background.
            </p>

        <div class="content_items ">
            <img src="img_discussion.jpeg" alt="" >
            <h3>Reflective Decision</h3>
            <p>As this was my first ever project to work with all these codes and web designs, learning through every process, I realized how much I have
                grown in understanding web development.All of my confusion found a way out in pretty beautiful way through style. This particular practical 
            project helped a lot in solidifying my learnings. <br>
        One of my major priority was to make this website user-friendly and very easily accessible, and I tried my best to do so. Here I learned the 
    importance of user-centered designs. Passing through a lots of planning and testing, I was able to achieve this. </p>

            <h3>Validation and Demonstration</h3>
            <p>It is important that my website meet the industry standard. So, to ensure that my websites's HTML and CSS met the industry standard,
                I validated my code through W3C validation tools. <br> To view the screenshots of validated codes with no error. Click Below:
